React JS is a front-end javascript library that offers 
tools for building user interfaces.
- developed by facebook! and supported by a large community
- competitors -> Vue and angular

everything works in a single page (we don't make multiple requests that reload the page)
- everything is done in JS and React

React updates the dom but it uses the virtual dom (javascript object)
which means that it only updates the section that has changed not the full page
- Virtual dom is way faster!! 

React JS is a component based library
- every React application is a tree of components 
- you break down the UI into independent reusable components
- Two Types of Components:

        - Class Based (not being used anymore! React history bbg)
                import React, {Component} from 'react'
                class MyClass extends Component {
                    render(){
                        return <div>Hello World!</div>
                    }
                }

                - you import react's component then create a JS class that extends 
                  Component which gives you a react component.
                - we use the render() method to describe how this component should look like

        - Functional

                import React from 'react'
                const example = () => {
                    return <div>Hello World!</div>
                }

                - we create a function (any type-> named, arrow, normal)
                  and in the function we return something that react should display
                * The return statement is not JS or HTML, it's JSX which describes how 
                  the UI should look like.
                  - it produces the React elements
